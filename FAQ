This is pretty short at the moment, but if it helps one person,
then that's good enough reason to at least write this much.

QUESTION AND ANSWER
===================

Q: Backspace is not working in rip. What can I do?

A: In your ~/.riprc file, change the backspace variable to
some other key code, for example you might try changing: 

backspace = "^H"  

to

backspace = "^?"

or to whatever characters are printing when you hit
backspace. That *ought* to work. 

Perl is not very good about dealing with different key codes
for backspace and this is the best I could do. Suggestions 
are welcome.



Q: I have a DVD drive that I want to rip from. What should I do?

A: The device flag can be useful here:  rip -d /dev/dvd

This does not solve all problems, likely, but ought to help
in some cases. A full command-line using -d would be
something like:  rip -d /dev/dvd -acT

This of course assumes that /dev/dvd or /dev/hdc or whatever
the heck you mean to rip from is a valid device within
the system. 

There was a bug concerning the -d flag, which should be 
fixed as of rip version 1.01.  If you do not think this
is the case, as always, email me.



Q: Can you change XYZ so that it does something different?

A: Yes, I can. Email me and I'll give it some thought.

I don't follow through on every suggestion, but if it sounds
like it would benefit enough people, I generally take it to heart
and actually make the change. 



Q: Can you add flag XYZ to rip?

A: Maybe. I don't know. Email me.

I am trying to keep rip lean and bloat-free, but if you have a
great suggestion, it might be worth asking.



Q: Can you add support for XYZ?

A: After I take a look at the encoder, ripper, or CDDB tool
I can make a better decision. As is generally the case, 
just email and ask.



Q: Why doesn't rip default to XYZ?

A: I tried to make decisions that seemed reasonable to me.
If you believe that rip would be better if the defaults were
different, then the best thing to do is alias rip to something
that suits you. If you like LAME, then do:  alias rip='rip -L'
or change your .riprc file (as of rip version 1.01). I just
added this, so it may not be robust, but you may add default
flags to a variable in that file so that you don't have to
add them each time you use rip at the command-line. Basically
it is for people who don't know how to alias commands. ;)
