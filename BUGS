If you have fixes for any bugs, please email them to smethegj@cs.wisc.edu

Known bugs:

None at the moment that I am aware of, but I am the programmer, so
the bugs never come around when I'm in the area. ;)

If you find a bug, be sure you use the -D flag while you run the
script, and then send me the /tmp/rip-stderr output file.
